# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Python-based car dealership application project. The codebase is currently in early development with minimal structure.

## Development Commands

Since this is a Python project without specific configuration files yet, use standard Python commands:

- Run Python files: `python Test.py` or `python3 Test.py`
- Run with debugging: `python -i Test.py`
- Check syntax: `python -m py_compile Test.py`

## Project Structure

The project currently contains:
- `Test.py` - Main Python file (currently empty)

## Notes for Future Development

- No package manager configuration detected (requirements.txt, pyproject.toml, etc.)
- No testing framework configured yet
- No linting/formatting tools configured
- Consider adding appropriate Python project structure as development progresses
